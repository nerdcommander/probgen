# _probgen_
probability with genetics, genetics with probability

## Purpose
We aim to merge probability and genetics teaching materials into one coherent, online, open source book accompanied by learning materials (hereafter referred to as ***probgen***). We recognized that probability can be counterintuitive, is often taught late in a formal mathematics education, and not frequently learned by life scientists. Our recent experience teaching together leads us to believe that there is a real need for teaching and explanatory materials in applied probability. We have begun to combine our knowledge, experience, and skills in framing and beginning ***probgen*** and will continue this productive collaboration.
